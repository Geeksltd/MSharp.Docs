# What is an M# Module?

M# generates ASP.NET view called "Module", which is placed in the "Modules" folder within "Website" project. M# uses HTML div design pattern to layout modules. M# allows developers to create as many modules as necessary on Model Entities, or special type modules like menus or generic.

Modules encapsulate the actual operation of any page in M#. Module types include forms, lists, menus or simple data views. Each module is developed based on an Entity Type.

### Adding a New Module

You can add a new module by right clicking on a created "Page" item in #UI project tree and selecting your desired module type.
