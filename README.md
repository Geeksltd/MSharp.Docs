# Learn M# (M-Sharp)

M# is a set of tools for rapid web application development. Unlike traditional RAD tools, M# is designed for mission-critical enterprise applications based on best-practices, rather than merely prototype/small apps. 

Developing with M# is about 4X faster than typical development models. It is based on a domain-driven declarative model. Such artefacts are simple and quick to create declaratively. They are then transformed into standard ASP.NET MVC and C# source code by the M# generator. As the end result is simply a standard Asp.net application, M# is risk-free to adopt and presents no "lock-in" or other business risks.

This website provides you with an architectural overview, as well as detailed examples and tutorials, to help you get started with your M# journey.

To begin, go through the items in the left hand side menu, starting from the top.
